# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationships between various passenger characteristics (such as age, gender, and passenger class) and their survival rates. The project involves data cleaning, visualization, and insights extraction using Python.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic details, passenger class, and whether they survived the disaster.

### Files in the Repository

- **train.csv**: The Titanic dataset used for the analysis. (Download from Kaggle)
- **Titanic_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values in the dataset:
  - Filled missing values in the `Age` column with the median age.
  - Filled missing values in the `Embarked` column with the most common port.
  - Dropped the `Cabin` column due to a large number of missing values.
- Converted data types where necessary to facilitate analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of individual variables such as `Survived`, `Pclass`, and `Age`.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored the relationships between two variables, such as survival rate by gender and passenger class.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Analyzed multiple variables together using correlation matrices and combined plots.

### 3. Key Insights

- Males had a lower survival rate compared to females.
- Passengers in higher classes (First and Second) had a better chance of survival compared to those in Third class.
- Younger passengers had a higher survival rate than older ones.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Titanic dataset reveals that survival was significantly influenced by gender, passenger class, and age:

Females had a higher survival rate than males.
First and Second Class passengers were more likely to survive than those in Third Class.
Younger passengers had better survival rates, reflecting the priority given to women and children.
